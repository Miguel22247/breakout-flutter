# breakout-flutter

## About the Project

A Breakout game implementation built with Flutter and Flame. Breakout is a classic arcade game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks at the top of the screen. This project leverages the power of Flutter for cross-platform development and the Flame game engine for smooth 2D game mechanics.

### Features
- Classic Breakout gameplay mechanics
- Built with Flutter for cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
- Powered by Flame game engine for efficient 2D rendering
- Responsive paddle controls
- Brick-breaking physics

### Planned Structure
Once the code is implemented, the typical structure will include:
- `lib/` - Main application code
  - `main.dart` - Application entry point
  - `game/` - Game logic and components
  - `components/` - Game entities (paddle, ball, bricks)
  - `screens/` - Different game screens
- `assets/` - Images, sounds, and other resources
- `test/` - Unit and widget tests
- `pubspec.yaml` - Flutter dependencies and configuration
